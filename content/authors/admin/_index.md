I am a fourth-year MS/PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at University of Florida (UF). I transferred to UF from the Robotics Engineering department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I earned my B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT), Pune, India in 2016. At VIT, I founded the Cognitive Robotics and Intelligent Systems Lab (CRISTL), which was the first lab on campus to use an integrated cognitive science, machine learning and logic-based AI approach to design intelligent robots. While conducting research and teaching at CRISTL, I was intrigued by the question about How to design an intelligent robot which can reason autonomously and, most importantly, in a provably-correct way? The quest to answer this question brought me to WPI, where under the guidance of Prof. Jie Fu, I am exploring the formal methods approach (a logic-based AI approach) to allow autonomous agents to not only reason in a provably-correct way but also use advanced behaviors like deception to their advantage. At WPI, I am a member of A&S Graduate Student Advisory Council and also represent my department in the Graduate Student Government (GSG).
