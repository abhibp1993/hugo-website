abstract:  Big data is becoming a common technical term wherever scientific computing, factory automation, information databases are to be managed for control and operation of facilities. The big data problem occurs in factory automation when the processing rate, decision making and computing algorithms slow down due to relatively big size of data, its complexity, variety and a number of operations to be done to operate any cyber-physical multi-location chemical factory. This is relatively a new area in control and automation field, although many such features exist in real life. However, the topic deserves further research to seek new solutions with growing complexity that arises due to nature and size of data.
